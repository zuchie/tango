A storm described as perhaps the strongest to hit California in five years barreled in from the Pacific Ocean on Thursday and hammered the state with all manner of weather misery — hurricane-force winds, sheets of rain and heavy snow in the mountains.

About 110,000 customers — down from a peak of more than 200,000 — remained without power late Thursday afternoon, including almost 17,000 in and around San Francisco, Pacific Gas & Electric told NBC News.

Trees were toppled, cars crashed and scattered flooding was reported. In Santa Cruz, an 80-foot tree fell and pinned an elementary school student for 15 minutes until rescuers freed him with chain saws, NBC station KSBW of Salinas reported. He was reported in good condition with a broken arm, while a girl whom the tree also hit suffered minor scratches.

Dozens of roads were closed in the northern half of the state, including parts of Interstate 5 near the Oregon line. Authorities warned drivers on the Bay Bridge to keep both hands on the wheel. Ferries to Alcatraz were canceled. Some Bay Area schools closed for the day, and people stocked up on supplies.
